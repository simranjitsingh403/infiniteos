Effective tools and processes are essential for incident response and recovery. Many organizations lack the internal resources to develop comprehensive crisis management frameworks, making external support crucial for contingency planning and stakeholder training.&quot;,&quot;problematic&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Cyber crises are inevitable; it\u2019s often just a matter of time. The consequences of a cyber attack extend beyond IT availability, affecting core processes like invoicing, procurement, and more. Effective crisis management tools and processes are crucial for incident response and recovery.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cyber incident can quickly escalate into a full-blown crisis, causing cross-functional disruptions across the business. Training and improving crisis management capabilities depend on developing a solid framework. This framework should document contingency plans and train stakeholders to navigate crises successfully.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many organizations struggle with limited resources, which hinders their ability to develop all the necessary tools for incident and crisis response internally.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;NEVERHACK supports customers from cyber crisis exercises to real crisis management. Cyber crises present unique risks that require a coordinated response, especially during the critical \u201cGolden Hour,\u201d where early actions significantly impact outcomes.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective communication with stakeholders is essential, as untrained teams may worsen the situation with poor decisions. NEVERHACK\u2019s Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance specialists develop crisis toolboxes, including contingency plans and business continuity reviews.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also design cyber crisis scenarios for training, from tabletop exercises to full IT simulations, ensuring all stakeholders are prepared. NEVERHACK ensures your business is resilient and ready to handle any cyber disaster.&lt;\/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;video_id&quot;:&quot;cyber_disaster_readiness&quot;,&quot;testimonial&quot;:{&quot;testimonial_author_name&quot;:&quot;Matthieu Benassar&quot;,&quot;testimonial_author_job&quot;:&quot;Managing Director at NEVERHACK France&quot;,&quot;testimonial_content&quot;:&quot;Whether it be through crisis simulation, the deployment of a business continuity strategy, or the design of a resilient IT architecture, I have found the challenges I was looking for when I joined NEVERHACK Resilience Center.

24\/7 security capabilities is costly, with in-house Security Operations Centers (SOCs) requiring heavy investments in technology, infrastructure, and skilled staff. As cyber threats rise and regulations tighten, these capabilities are essential. Partnering with a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) ensures strong cybersecurity and business continuity without the financial burden of an in-house SOC.&quot;,&quot;problematic&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Developing internal 24\/7 security capabilities is highly expensive and challenging to sustain over time.
